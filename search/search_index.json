Tools & Setup Prerequisites Flutter & Dart SDK (Flutter version 3.22.2 is recommended) An IDE (Android Studio recommended, Visual Studio Code, or IntelliJ IDEA) To edit this project, ensure that Flutter and Dart are installed and configured successfully on your machine. Set up your editor - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins. If you have the Android SDK installed and configured, follow the steps below to install Flutter. Complete Flutter installation guide Android Studio \u2013 Windows Setup Here we'll know how to install Android Studio in a Windows machine. Download Android Studio Get the Flutter SDK Learn more about Android Studio Step 1: Get the Flutter SDK Download the installation bundle for the latest stable Flutter release. Extract the .zip file and place the flutter folder in your desired installation location (e.g., C:\\src\\flutter ). Avoid directories that require elevated privileges, like C:\\Program Files\\ . Step 2: Update your PATH To run Flutter commands from the regular Windows console: Search for \"env\" and select Edit environment variables . Under User variables , check if there's an entry for Path . If it exists, append the full path to flutter\\bin using ; as a separator. If not, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\\bin . Close and reopen any existing console windows to apply the changes. Step 3: Run flutter doctor From a console window with the Flutter directory in your PATH, run: c:\\src\\flutter>flutter doctor This command checks for any platform dependencies you need to resolve. Learn more . Android Studio \u2013 macOS Setup Download and Install Required Software Download Android Studio Download Xcode Get the Flutter SDK Step 1: Get the Flutter SDK Download and extract the installation bundle to get the latest Flutter SDK. Move the extracted flutter folder to your desired location (e.g., Documents/flutter ). Step 2: Update Your PATH To access Flutter commands from the terminal: For the current terminal window: export PATH=\"$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin\" To Set the PATH Permanently on macOS Open or Create .bash_profile Use the following command to open or create the .bash_profile file in your home directory: bash sudo open -e $HOME/.bash_profile 2. Append the PATH Export Line Add the following line to the bottom of the .bash_profile file: bash export PATH=\"$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin\" Replace [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] with the actual path to your Flutter SDK directory 3.

Step 2: Update Your PATH To access the Flutter command from the terminal, you'll need to update your PATH environment variable. You can choose to update it for the current terminal session only or permanently. Option 1: Update PATH for Current Session To temporarily add Flutter to your PATH: export PATH=\"$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin\" This change will only last for the current terminal window. Update PATH Permanently for Flutter on Linux Option 2: Update PATH Permanently To ensure Flutter commands are accessible from any terminal session, you need to update the PATH environment variable permanently.

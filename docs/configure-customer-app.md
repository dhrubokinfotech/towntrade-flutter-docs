# Configure The Customer App

Let’s open the `towntrade` project from our bundle with Android Studio. Since we have already done the necessary setup for Flutter and Android, it should detect the flutter project and start indexing the files and other things.

To make the Towntrade customer app functional, It’s necessary to build and configure the Towntrade-Admin app first. Since we have completed that process in the previous section, we can assume that the product owner has already configured the required app data like Product Categories, Subcategories, Service Locations, and lots of other things. If these are not configured, then the customer app users will not be able to use the app.

We'll discuss the process in the following pages sequentially:

- ## [Rename the App & Package Name](rename-app-and-package-name.md)

- ## [Connect the App with the Firebase Project](connect-app-firebase.md)

- ## [Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging or Push Notification](firebase-cloud-messaging.md)

- ## [Connect The Customer App to Back4App](connect-back4ap.md)

- ## [Build the Customer App for Android](build-android-app.md)

- ## [Build the Customer App for iOS](build-ios-app.md)

- ## [Push Notification in iOS](push-notification-ios.md)

- ## [Additional Notes](additional-notes.md)
